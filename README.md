# Code Guidelines

This repository contains a collection of **coding guidelines and best practices** for different programming languages and technologies.  
The goal is to ensure code across all projects is **consistent, maintainable, and easy to understand**, regardless of the language or framework.

## Why Guidelines?

- **Consistency** â€“ A shared style reduces friction when switching between projects or teams.
- **Readability** â€“ Code should be easy to read and understand for everyone, not just its author.
- **Maintainability** â€“ Clear patterns and conventions make it easier to extend and refactor code.
- **Quality** â€“ Following proven practices helps avoid bugs and design pitfalls.

## Structure

Guidelines are organized by language and topic. Each folder contains a `README.md` or dedicated document with conventions for that specific technology.

- [C# Guidelines](./csharp/README.md)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines](./javascript/README.md)
- [General Git & Collaboration Guidelines](./git/README.md)

ðŸ“Œ Not all languages may have full guidelines yet.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Before starting a new project, check the relevant language guidelines.
2. When contributing code, follow the conventions listed here.
3. If you find gaps, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement, open a pull request.
4. Treat these documents as **living guidelines** â€” they will evolve over time as practices change.

**This repository is a work in progress and is meant to be continuously refined as technologies and best practices evolve.**
